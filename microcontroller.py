Microcontroller code


'''
parts to control:
	cooling fan
	heating element
	timer
	slot mechanism
Use case:
- User inserts food, then sends instruction
					OR
  User sends instruction, then inserts food
- Toaster lowers food into position
- Toaster cooks food using provided instructions
- Toaster raises food out of position

One thread for each slot. Two slots, so two threads
A separate thread should listen for instructions from user. Write to data structure which the main code reads from? Its writing takes priority over main program's reading


Instruction validity check:
	Is indicated timer value positive?
	  N: report entry error
	Is indicated temperature value greater than some threshold?
	  N: report low temperature


Cook food:
	loop until timer is no longer positive:
		if abort,
			set timer to 0
			disable heating mechanism
			exit loop
		read temperature
		if temperature is too low,
			increase power to heating element
		if temperature is too high,
			decrease power to heating element

When instructions/confirmation received:
	Are instructions valid?
	 N: report
	 Y: Note that valid instructions received

When food inserted:
	Note that food inserted

If food inserted and valid instructions received,
	lower slot mechanism
		wait for mechanism to complete
	set heating element
	enable cooling fan
	set timer
	cook food
	set timer to 0
	disable heating element
	disable cooling fan
	raise slot mechanism
		wait for mechanism to complete
